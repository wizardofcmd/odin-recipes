    <p>I'll let you in on a secret. Pancakes are my favourite breakfast food. If they aren't
        yours, let me change your mind with this recipe.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup/120g Buckwheat Flour</li>
        <li>1 cup/90g Porridge Oats</li>
        <li>1 cup/120g Roasted Pumpkin Flesh</li>
        <li>1 & 1/2 cup/325ml Non Dairy Milk</li>
        <li>4 tbs Maple Syrup</li>
        <li>Pinch of Sea Salt</li>
        <li>2 tsp Baking Powder</li>
        <li>3 tbs Chia Seeds</li>
        <li>2 Scoops Nuzest Clean Lean Protein Powder</li>
        <li>1 tbs Coconut Oil for frying</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>To serve:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Nuts</li>
        <li>Berries</li>
        <li>Maple Syrup</li>
        <li>Seeds</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>I usually roast a pumpkin or squash the day before if I know I'm making these. The mix works better when the
            pumpkin is cold. </li>
        <li>First up, mash the pumpkin flesh in a mixing bowl then add all the rest of the ingredients & mix together to
            form a slightly thick batter.</li>
        <li>Pre heat a non stick pan over a very low heat and lightly grease with the coconut oil.</li>
        <li>When the pan is hot, ladle in the batter. I usually make 3 inch pancakes which is around 5 tbs worth of
            batter.</li>
        <li>Cook for 3-4 minutes on each side.</li>
        <li>Between cooking each pancake carefully grease the pan with coconut oil to stop them from sticking. I use
            kitchen paper to rub the oil into the pan.</li>
        <li>Once you've cooked all the pancakes, stack them up & serve with you choice of garnishes.</li>
    </ol>
