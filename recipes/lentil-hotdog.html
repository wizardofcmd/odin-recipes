    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 tbs Olive Oil</li>
        <li>1/2 an Onion, Chopped Small</li>
        <li>2 Clove of Garlic, Minced</li>
        <li>2 Portobello Mushrooms, Chopped Small</li>
        <li>100g Walnuts</li>
        <li>1 Pouch Merchant Gourmet Puy Lentils</li>
        <li>100g Cooked Sweet Potato</li>
        <li>1 tbs Chipotle Paste</li>
        <li>1/4 tsp Sweet Smoked Paprika</li>
        <li>1/4 tsp Dried Oregano</li>
        <li>2 tbs Tomato Purée</li>
        <li>1 tbs Balsamic Vinegar</li>
        <li>5 tbs Heaped Plain Flour</li>
        <li>25g Dried Breadcrumbs</li>
        <li>1/4 tsp Cracked Black Pepper</li>
        <li>1/4 tsp Sea Salt</li>
    </ul>
    <p><em>Optional Garnishes</em></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Hot Dog Rolls</li>
        <li>Mustard</li>
        <li>Ketchup</li>
        <li>1/2 an Onion, finely chopped</li>
        <li>1/2 a Green Pepper, finely chopped</li>
        <li>Crispy Onions</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>First up sauté the onion, garlic & mushrooms over a medium heat in a little olive oil until golden, be sure
            to make sure all the liquid has evaporated from the mushrooms. Once sautéed, transfer the mix from the pan
            to a bowl.</li>
        <li>Add the walnuts to your food processor & blitz them to a crumb. Next add the lentils & sweet potato to the
            food processor, pulse 2-3 times to lightly break up the potato & lentils.</li>
        <li>Add the walnuts, potato & lentils to the bowl with the mushrooms, onion & garlic, followed by all the
            remaining sausage ingredients then mix well with a spatula. The sausage mix should be relatively dry but if
            your mixture feels too wet, add a little more flour or breadcrumbs.</li>
        <li>Lightly flour your hands then form the mixture into around 8-10 sausages.</li>
        <li>The sausages are now ready to be cooked on your bbq, or alternatively in a non stick frying pan or oven.
        </li>
        <li>For bbq cooking, I recommend cooking the sausage over hot coals rather than a naked flame, make sure your
            grill is clean and greased well with a little oil. Grill the sausages for 7-8 minutes turning them carefully
            every now and then.</li>
        <li>Alternatively for cooking them in a pan, pre heat your non stick frying pan over a medium heat and sauté the
            sausages for 8-10 minutes, turning them over every now and then.</li>
        <li>I serve my hot dogs topped with all my favourite trimmings such as, finely chopped onion & pepper, crispy
            onion, mustard and ketchup.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>The sausages can be pre made and stored in your fridge for up to 2-3 days before cooking.</p>
